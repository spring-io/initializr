Spring Initializr provides an extensible API to generate JVM-based projects with
implementations for several common concepts:

* Basic language generation for Java, Kotlin and Groovy.
* Build system abstraction with implementations for Apache Maven and Gradle.
* `.gitignore` support.
* Several hook-points for custom resources generations.

The various options for the projects are expressed in a metadata model that allows you to
configure the list of dependencies, supported JVM and platform versions, etc.

Spring Initializr also exposes web endpoints to generate an actual project and also
serve its metadata in a well-known format to allow third-party clients to provide the
necessary assistance.

A set of optional conventions for Spring Boot projects is provided and are used in our
production instance at link:https://start.spring.io[]. To better understand how our
service is configured, you may want to check {service}[the companion project] and, in
particular, the
{service}/blob/master/start-site/src/main/resources/application.yml[configuration of our
instance]. Such configuration is also described in details in the documentation.

NOTE: While Spring Initializr is available on Maven Central, it is still in a pre 1.0
state and major refactoring are still possible. Check the
https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/milestones[milestones page] for an overview of the
changes.

== Installation and Getting Started
The reference documentation is available in {docs}/html/[HTML format].


== Modules
Spring Initializr has the following modules:

* `initializr-actuator`: optional module to provide additional information and statistics
on project generation.
* `initializr-bom`: provides a Bill of Materials for easier dependency management in your
project.
* `initializr-docs`: documentation.
* `initializr-generator`: core project generation library.
* `initializr-generator-spring`: optional module defining the conventions for a typical
Spring Boot project. Can be reused or replaced by your own conventions.
* `initializr-generator-test`: test infrastructure for project generation.
* `initializr-metadata`: metadata infrastructure for various aspects of the project.
* `initializr-service-sample`: showcases a basic custom instance.
* `initializr-version-resolver`: optional module to extract version numbers from an
arbitrary POM.
* `initializr-web`: web endpoints for third party clients.

== Supported interfaces
Spring Initializr can be used as follows:

* On the command-line with {boot-doc}/#cli-init[the Spring Boot CLI] or simply with
`cURL` or `HTTPie`.
* In your IDE if you are using STS, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, NetBeans (with
https://github.com/AlexFalappa/nb-springboot[this plugin]) or VSCode (with
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-spring-initializr[the `vscode-spring-initializr`
plugin]).
* With a custom Web UI (check ours at link:https://start.spring.io[]).

There are other command-line integrations out there and you can also build your own!

== Running your own instance
You can easily run your own instance. The `initializr-web` modules uses Spring Boot
so when it is added to a project, it will trigger the necessary auto-configuration to
deploy the service.

The `initializr-service-sample` showcases a basic custom instance with dedicated metadata.

== Building from Source
You need Java 1.8 and a bash-like shell.
